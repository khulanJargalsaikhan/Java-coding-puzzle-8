	Given 3 int arguments - a, b, c, return their sum. However, if one of the arguments 
	is the same as any of the other ones, that number should not count towards the sum. 
	So basically you only sum unique numbers, not duplicates


	 EXPECTATIONS:
		sumUnique(1, 2, 3)   --- 6
		sumUnique(3, 2, 3)   --- 2
		sumUnique(3, 3, 3)   --- 0
